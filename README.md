Project Report and Insights: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SemDPjtKB7vVL3DjSr8uJrTXULx18xf-hcsATXZNWio/edit?usp=sharing

Setup:
1. Install Python3

Usage:
1. python3 search.py
2. python3 lazyAstar.py

Notes:
1. randomForest.py is not entirely functional.
2. To enable and disable animations, go into the files with the corresdponding search algorithms and comment or comment commands in main at the bottom of the respective files.
3. We recommend not running the animation for 'maze4.txt' as it is very large and takes a very long time to run.
